# What was my motivation?
- I was 10 years old when I first played with an Etch-A-Sketch. They seemed really cool for what you could do with them. I wasn't that great. But the idea of making one on a program seemed like a fun idea. 

# Why did I build this project?
- Making this app required a solid understanding of CSS and Javascript. I needed more practice and this project was perfect for it. 

# What did I learn?
- Planning. Planning. Planning. Honestly, if I could just plan out my ideas before I do any code, I'd have less stress and be more efficient.
